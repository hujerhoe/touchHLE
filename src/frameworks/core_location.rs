//! The Core Location framework.
//!
//! Proper implementation of this framework _could_ make sense on Android,
//! but it seems like early iOS games were using it exclusively to
//! ~~spy on~~ track users without actual location-based gameplay.
//!
//! Some apps (e.g. maps) would _require_ location support to work properly,
//! but it is not the current focus of the touchHLE. The current focus is,
//! you know, **GAMES**.
